# Work Day Scheduler

## Description
I wanted to create a javascript code that enable me to create a weather dashboard. The user will then be presented with a search bar where a city can then be imputed. The result should then display the current temp, wind speed, and humidity of the day. A 5-Day forecast will also be presented under the current day. The search results will then be kept in local storage. Under the search bar will be the citys the user has searched.
